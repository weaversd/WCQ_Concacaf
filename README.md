Predictions are based on margin of victory against an average team [The Power Rank](https://thepowerrank.com/world-football-soccer/), and using a method based on [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-club-soccer-predictions-work/)'s soccer predictions.  

'Magic number' plot is based on [Playoff Magic](https://www.playoffmagic.com/fifa/major-league-soccer/)'s format. In this case, the first number is the number of points required to secure a spot, and the second number is the total number of points remaining for a team. Remember that the points (for the first number) can come from the team earning them, or the team above/below dropping them.
